# Data Atlas

## What is it?

This application is focused on creating a modular abstraction to ingest CSV files directly to your database. The key features this provides is that the user does not need to know about the database only which database column they want to map data to.

The front-end client allows users to have the ability to drag/drop columns in their CSV to database fields and edit the non-validated entries in the browser.

## Project Structure

* The Client Application is located in the `/client/` directory
* The REST API is located in the `/server/` directory

## Moving Forward

* More documentation
* More easily (distributed) way to standup both services
